# Restaurants

#### Family Diner

I've played a number of roles in a few different restaurants. Currently I cook at [North Chili Family Restaurant](http://ncfr.info). I'm there for dinners on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Come check us out! Best food in town. Everything's homemade.

#### Pizza Shop

My first job was with a local pizza shop under the direction of Steve Enos, Spencerport's finest restauranteer. Let me tell you, the guy knows how to run a shop smoothly and keep customers happy. In addition to making pizza from scratch, I'm indebted to Steve for teaching me what it takes to run a shop by maintaining the respect from your crew.

#### Friendly's Ice Cream

I worked at a couple locations: [Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York) and [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York). One of my managers, Louis, was a top notch fella. Every night I'd arrive, "Louis, we gonna have a good night!" - "YEA BABY!" And we did, consistently. I dish washed, cleaned bathrooms, mopped, cleaned, unloaded the delivery truck, and restocked the shop. I don't like seeing this work done half-assed. Most people think they're above it all. I assure you, they're not.
