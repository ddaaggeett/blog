# Engineering

### Classical

I worked for a couple years as a junior structural engineer designing steel connections for building fabrication. I studied civil engineering at the University at Buffalo and physics at Fredonia. I have a very sharp sense of spacial orientation and force application.

### Computers

Over the last few years I've grown heavily interested in software development. My future aim is to find work in this domain as my domestic responsibilities come to pass. In the mean time I plan to continue my ever-so-slowly venture into this practice.
