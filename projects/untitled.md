# Music

I'd like to share music that I make myself, but it would mean nothing unless I first spent a bit of time sharing the work of musicians I admire.

### Jazz

I'm a big fan of jazz. My introduction to this behemoth music style started with my short-lived obsession with an album of the honkey tonk rockstar, [Glenn Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller). Classic big band has played a major influence on my appreciation for playing sax under direction of my first true musical educator, [John Viavattine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Viavattine), a Rochester heavy hitter. His direction gave me proper introduction to playing with a purpose, though I never did master standard techniques of the horn. One day...

[Kirk Whalum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Whalum) was my first saxophonist obsession. Then came [Michael Brecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker), of course - the standard voice of all modern saxophonists. Then there was [Joshua Redman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Redman), [Kenny Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Garrett) \(the real Kenny G\), [Bob Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Berg), and lately [Bob Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Reynolds_%28saxophonist%29) and [Chad Lefkowitz-Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Lefkowitz-Brown).

Outside of my favorite sax players, I do have other influences. I love the music of Mike Stern, Victor Wooten, Steve Gadd, Marcus Miller,

### Pop

I've never really been a fan of pop music. I do have a couple playlists with artists who put out some catchy tunes here and there, but I can't help but point out that real music is substantiated by instrumentation, first and foremost. I only consider real music as that which is built with authentic instrumentation.

Lead voices that carry a melody are great music makers, but are unable to support themselves without the lower-level substantiation of a rhythm section. I do not consider vocalists alone to be authentic musicians unless they produce their own underlaying harmony. This may seem harsh, but having been a lead saxophone voice I can assure you it means nothing unless you're substantiated by a rhythm section with a fuller understanding of the music theory.

### Whistling

I've always had a knack for belting the squealer.
