# Faith

I was raised [Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism). I have no issue with the choices by which my family introduced me to a useful moral construct. I am aware of the desire to live by a moral compass, though I do not think almost anyone takes upon themselves the significance of \[God\] seriously enough, and therefore can understand what truly constructs their belief system.

I've recently become enthused by the [psychological significance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G-v3WMmdUY&list=PLKO9AFm3pJHapMm8hh8CG9FEdkGMTQSuC) of why there would be a god, but I'm still enamored with the skepticism and appeal of why secular humanism \(atheism\) makes more sense \(to me\).

[Bret Weinstein illuminates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRsPsTrCvpw&feature=youtu.be&list=WL&t=5118) my perspective of the functional purpose of religious faith. So, I guess you can say I'm a religious centrist. Any believer's claim of certainty is more likely full of crap than not.
