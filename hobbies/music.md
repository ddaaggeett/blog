# Music

I'd like to share music that I make myself, but it would mean nothing unless I first spent a bit of time sharing the work of musicians I admire.

#### Jazz

I'm a big fan of jazz. My introduction to this behemoth music style started with my short-lived obsession with an album of the honkey tonk rockstar, [Glenn Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller). Classic big band has played a major influence on my appreciation for playing sax under direction of my first musical educator, [John Viavattine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Viavattine), a Rochester heavy hitter. His direction gave me proper introduction to playing with a purpose, though I never did master standard techniques of the horn. One day...

[Kirk Whalum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Whalum) was my first saxophonist obsession. Then came [Michael Brecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker), of course - the standard voice of all modern saxophonists. Then there was [Joshua Redman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Redman), [Kenny Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Garrett) \(the real Kenny G\), [Bob Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Berg), and lately [Bob Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Reynolds_%28saxophonist%29) and [Chad Lefkowitz-Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Lefkowitz-Brown).

Outside of my favorite sax players, I do have other influences. I love the music of [Mike Stern](http://www.mikestern.org/), [Victor Wooten](https://www.victorwooten.com/), [Steve Gadd](https://www.drstevegadd.com/), [Marcus Miller](http://www.marcusmiller.com/) ...

#### Pop

I've never really been a fan of pop music. I think possibly ninety nine percent of the people who consider themselves musicians are, in fact, not at all.

With that said, I believe [Ed Sheeran](http://www.edsheeran.com/) to be the greatest musician of our generation.
