#### [The Virtue of Selfishness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness) - [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand)

If you're going to dig into what Ayn Rand is all about, I highly recommend this book before others.

This author is trigger happy when it comes to a stance against [collectivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism) narrative, and for good reason: she experienced first-hand a society predicated upon the collectivist morality and was fortunate enough to move to one instead predicated upon the individual. She thoroughly details the philosophy of Objectivism by which individual freedom is to take precedence over collective authority. The morality she develops is solid, and as far as I can tell, would only be objected by those with some sort of political agenda.

#### [12 Rules for Life](https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/) - [Jordan B Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/about/)

Perhaps one of the greatest minds in the modern era. Peterson's clinical practice has eqipped him with understanding the breadth of darkness the human mind is able to wander off to and is able to articulate how the individual has the power to be humanity's devastation or its salvation. He makes a clear case as to how it's under the jurisdiction of the individual, however, to harness this capacity for malevolence and be a light on the world instead of a blight.

#### [The Righteous Mind](http://righteousmind.com/) - [Jonathan Haidt](http://righteousmind.com/about-the-author/biosketch/)

#### [Explaining Postmodernism](https://www.amazon.com/Explaining-Postmodernism-Skepticism-Socialism-Rousseau/dp/0983258406/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525296054&sr=8-1&keywords=explaining+postmodernism) - [Stephen Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hicks)
