#### [The Virtue of Selfishness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness) - [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand)

If you're going to dig into what Ayn Rand is all about, I highly recommend this book before others.

This author is trigger happy when it comes to a stance against [collectivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism) narrative, and for good reason: she experienced first-hand a society predicated upon the collectivist morality and was fortunate enough to move to one instead predicated upon the individual. She thoroughly details the philosophy of Objectivism by which individual freedom is to take precedence over collective authority. She is precise in her thought.

#### [12 Rules for Life](https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/) - [Jordan B Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/about/)

Perhaps one of the greatest minds in the modern era. Peterson's clinical practice has eqipped him with understanding the breadth of darkness the human mind is able to wander off to and is able to articulate how the individual has the power to be humanity's devastation or its salvation. He makes a clear case as to how it's under the jurisdiction of the individual, however, to harness this capacity for malevolence and be a light on the world instead of a blight. He is precise in his thought.

#### [The Righteous Mind](http://righteousmind.com/) - [Jonathan Haidt](http://righteousmind.com/about-the-author/biosketch/)

Circumnavigating the great debate between individualism and group ethics, Haidt prominently distinguishes motives behind unconscious bias on either side of the political spectrum. It's enlightening to consider how one's impeccable sense of morality can simply be predicated upon disgust toward another subject. It makes one wonder the whether validity or even necessity of a particular morality is had to keep one's self interest in tact, or to hold over others as a beacon of virtue. The former would be an honest approach to a morality, but in and of itself, rightfully, contradicts the idea of collectivist ethics. The latter is the only ingredient for polarizing a civilized world. 

#### [The Secret Knowledge on the Dismantling of American Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Knowledge-Dismantling-American-Culture/dp/B005GBVHVY) - [David Mamet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet)

#### [Explaining Postmodernism](https://www.amazon.com/Explaining-Postmodernism-Skepticism-Socialism-Rousseau/dp/0983258406/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525296054&sr=8-1&keywords=explaining+postmodernism) - [Stephen Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hicks)
